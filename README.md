# HW3: Graph Ops

* Intended to completed within graph.py (provided as-is).

* 3 Problems, 20 + 20 + 10 Points

 In my reference solution:

 Problems 0 and 1 are solvable in 4-7 lines with a single loop and single if

 Problem 2 is solvable in a single line.

 I didn't save the work in class somehow again so the allPaths implementation is different, but should be correct.
