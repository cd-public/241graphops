# HW3: Graph Ops

Intended to completed within graph.py (provided as-is).

3 Problems, 20 + 20 + 10 Points, described and with sample tests in hw3.py

 In my reference solution:

* Problems 0 and 1 are solvable in 4-7 lines with a single loop and single if

* Problem 2 is solvable in a single line.

* I didn't save the work in class somehow again so the allPaths implementation is different, but should be correct.
